The project titled "Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning: An Approach to Sample Dimension Engineering" aims to address the challenges of forecasting Bitcoin's highly volatile prices. The study employs tailored deep learning models to analyze data at two granularitiesâ€”daily and 5-minute intervals. By integrating feature engineering and optimizing model complexity based on data structure, the project achieves improved accuracy, offering valuable insights for financial decision-making and advancing the application of AI in dynamic financial markets.
